Some Info On The Project:

Urban planners and engineers are integrating nature-based solutions to address contemporary environmental, social and economic challenges. The EU-funded EuPOLIS project deploys natural systems to enhance public health and well-being and create resilient urban ecosystems. It designs a structured approach that integrates existing natural and engineered urban systems and defines their joint social, cultural and economic effects. The project aims to regenerate and rehabilitate urban ecosystems to create inclusive and accessible urban spaces. It addresses key challenges such as low environmental quality and low biodiversity in public spaces, water-stressed resources and undervalued use of space. The projectâ€™s solutions are tested in four cities: Belgrade, Lodz, Piraeus and Gladsaxe.
